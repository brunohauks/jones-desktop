This is a JavaFX application that basically merges hundreds of xml files into one single spreadsheet.
It was designed for law firms acting in Brazil, in order to help them process the so called NFe (eletronic invoice).
Such firms would merge them manually which was taking many resources and time. This application is able to process over 400 xml files in around 3 minutes. The XML files are resonably large, since they hold information about the merchant, the buyer and products involved in the purchase.

The reasons why I used JavaFx:

1. Wanted to learn more about it

2. Uploading the files to a webserver was not an option (files should stay local, as required by the law firms)

3. Easy-to-use tools available to build the UI (SceneBuilder, Docs)

4. Why not ?
